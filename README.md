# QLD-Fuel-Price-Informer
JavaScript that shows current Queensland fuel prices from FDP API PROD (QLD Gov API)
First attempt to code in JavaScript (nightmare actually). 
Uses JS and Jquery to pull in and merge JSON objects, then displays relevant information when hovering over the marker with a dropdown fuel slection option

If have time, need to JSON grap, can also add nearest station to current location etc
