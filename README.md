# QLD-Fuel-Price-Informer
JavaScript that shows current Queensland fuel prices from FDP API PROD (QLD Gov API)
First attempt to code in JavaScript (nightmare actually). 
A continuation for the QLD fuel price locator. This JS pulls in and merges to JSON objects and displays relevant information when hovering over the marker.
